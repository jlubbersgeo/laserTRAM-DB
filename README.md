# ```LaserTRAM-DB```: A dashboard for the complete laser ablation icp-ms data reduction pipeline. 

LaserTRAM-DB is a dashboard for the complete processing pipeline of Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) data in complex materials such as geologic samples. As LA-ICP-MS data in geologic samples frequently have multiple phases, inclusions, and other compositional complexities within them that do not represent the material of interest, user interaction is required to filter unwanted signals out of the overall ablation signal. LaserTRAM-DB allows the user to filter which portion of the ablation peak is utilized in calculating concentrations, subsequently allowing for more accurate data to be obtained. Furthermore, it allows for the processing of both individual spot analysis data and a line of spots gathered in rapid succession, reducing the time required for data reduction while preserving spatial definition and still ensuring data quality.

## Statement of Need

With a wide array of applications in the natural sciences (e.g., Caricchi et al., 2020; Fritz-Endres and Fehrenbacher 2021; Loewen and Kent 2012; Lukacs et al., 2021), laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a now a commonplace tool for the gathering of in situ trace element (i.e., < 0.1 wt%) data from solid materials. The last two decades have seen significant advances in both instrument capabilities and operating software, allowing users to generate large volumes of in situ geochemical data in comparatively little time to previous methodologies (i.e., micro-drilling) while still maintaining high degrees of accuracy and precision.

Raw data output from LA-ICP-MS, however, is in the form of counts per second (cps) for the selected analyte isotopes, not elemental concentrations. In order to be converted into accurate concentrations, a modest amount of user input and interpretation is required and should not be automated. Currently, there are several proprietary and open-source softwares for LA-ICP-MS data reduction to accomplish this task: SILLS - (Guillong et al., 2008); Iolite - (Paton et al., 2011); LAtools - (Branson et al., 2019); Termite - (Mischel et al., 2017); GLITTER - Macquarie University GEMOC; and countless other “in house” spreadsheet-based tools. All have their strengths and weaknesses, however, there is yet to be a powerful, web-hosted Graphical User Interface (GUI). Built primarily using ```Plotly-Dash```, ```numpy```, and ```pandas```, we present a completely open-source dashboard: Laser Time Resolved Analysis Module Dashboard (LaserTRAM-DB) that allows the user to calculate concentrations from raw LA-ICP-MS data with the flexibility of a GUI interface while maintaining the performance of the numerical python ecosystem. Furthermore, by simultaneously displaying both raw data cps and internal standard normalized cps, it allows for rapid decision making about data quality to be determined. It is comprised of three parts:

It is comprised of 3 parts: 
1. **LaserTRAM:** Choosing an interval of interest from raw cps data in individual spot analyses and normalizing it to an internal standard.

2. **LaserTRAM profiler:** Functionally the same as LaserTRAM, however has tools that allow for the rapid inspection of a line of spot analyses gathered in quick succession.

3. **LaserCalc:** Takes the output from either LaserTRAM or LaserTRAM profiler and converts the normalized data into concentrations using the equations outlined below.

## Installation and Use

The easiest way to use LaserTRAM-DB is to use the following link: 

[lasertram-db.herokuapp.com](https://lasertram-db.herokuapp.com/)

Alternatively, LaserTRAM-DB can be installed locally and run by creating a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#installing-virtualenv):

### MacOS
```
git clone https://github.com/jlubbersgeo/laserTRAM-DB
cd /path/to/laserTRAM-DB
python3 -m venv lasertram-db
source ./lasertram-db/bin/activate
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
python lasertram-db.py
```

When the program is running, copy and paste the provided link provided in the terminal window into the browswer window and the app will run. 

You can close the program by entering ```ctrl + c``` in the terminal window or simply exiting the terminal window. 

### Windows
```
git clone https://github.com/jlubbersgeo/laserTRAM-DB
cd /path/to/laserTRAM-DB
python3 -m venv lasertram-db
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
python lasertram-db.py
```

When the program is running, copy and paste the provided link provided in the terminal window into the browswer window and the app will run. 

To exit the program here, simply close the terminal window.

### Caveats
- If you are completely new to [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), make sure they are installed on your machine.
- You will have to re-create the virtual environment each time you wish to use LaserTRAM-DB.
